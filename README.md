# 42 School Mobile Piscine

This repository contains mobile applications created as part of the 42 school mobile piscine. The purpose of the piscine is to learn a new language, and in this project, we have implemented three different apps:

1. **Weather App**: An application that provides real-time weather information based on user input or current location.

2. **Diary App**: A diary application where users can record their thoughts, experiences, and important events.

3. **Calculator**: A basic calculator app for performing mathematical operations.

## Technologies Used

- Flutter: The framework used for developing cross-platform mobile applications.
